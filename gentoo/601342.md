## Background

[net-nds/openldap USE=kerberos with app-crypt/heimdal compile fails](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=601342)

It appears that a kerberos virtual provider `app-crypt/heimdal` is causing compile failures for `net-nds/openldap` with the kerberos USE flag enabled.

## Reproduction

As dealing with a virtual provider, the first thing I did was install heimdal to make it the go to for `virtual/krb5`. After that I compiled openldap with the kerberos USE flag to see what happened. I did indeed get the same error:

```
* Compiling contrib-module: kinit
libtool: compile:  x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -DSLAPD_OVER_KINIT=SLAPD_MOD_DYNAMIC -I/var/tmp/portage/net-nds/openldap-2.4.43/work/openldap-2.4.43-abi_x86_64.amd64/include -I../../../include -I../../../servers
/slapd -march=native -O2 -pipe -c kinit.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/kinit.o
kinit.c:28:23: fatal error: krb5/krb5.h: No such file or directory
#include <krb5/krb5.h>
```

## Analysis

First thing is to copy the source directories for doing recursive diffs just in case I need to change files:

```
# cp -a openldap-2.4.43 openldap-2.4.43.orig
```

Now it's time to check for the offending error file which is related to the kinit contrib-module.:

```
# cd openldap-2.4.43/
openldap-2.4.43 # find . -iname 'kinit'
./contrib/slapd-modules/kinit
```

Now to see what it looks like:

```
# cd contrib/slapd-modules/kinit/
tikuwa kinit # ls
kinit.c  Makefile  README
```

A single Makefile seems a bit odd. Maybe this is outside of autotools? Time to check the Makefile contents:

```
# $OpenLDAP$

LDAP_SRC = ../../..
LDAP_BUILD = $(LDAP_SRC)
LDAP_INC = -I$(LDAP_BUILD)/include -I$(LDAP_SRC)/include -I$(LDAP_SRC)/servers/slapd
LDAP_LIB = $(LDAP_BUILD)/libraries/libldap_r/libldap_r.la \
        $(LDAP_BUILD)/libraries/liblber/liblber.la

LIBTOOL = $(LDAP_BUILD)/libtool
CC = gcc
OPT = -g -O2 -Wall
DEFS =
INCS = $(LDAP_INC)
LIBS = $(LDAP_LIB) -lkrb5

PROGRAMS = kinit.la
LTVER = 0:0:0

prefix=/usr/local
exec_prefix=$(prefix)
ldap_subdir=/openldap

libdir=$(exec_prefix)/lib
libexecdir=$(exec_prefix)/libexec
moduledir = $(libexecdir)$(ldap_subdir)
.SUFFIXES: .c .o .lo

.c.lo:
        $(LIBTOOL) --mode=compile $(CC) $(OPT) $(DEFS) $(INCS) -c $<

all: $(PROGRAMS)

kinit.la: kinit.lo
        $(LIBTOOL) --mode=link $(CC) $(OPT) -version-info $(LTVER) \
        -rpath $(moduledir) -module -o $@ $? $(LIBS)

clean:
        rm -rf *.o *.lo *.la .libs

install: $(PROGRAMS)
        mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(moduledir)
        for p in $(PROGRAMS) ; do \
                $(LIBTOOL) --mode=install cp $$p $(DESTDIR)$(moduledir) ; \
        done
```

This doesn't look automake generated. Now it's time to figure out where the include file in question is or if it even exists in the heimdal package:

```
# grep "krb5.h" /var/db/pkg/app-crypt/heimdal-1.5.3-r2/CONTENTS
obj /usr/share/man/man3/krb5_h_errno_to_heim_errno.3 48a9952f454153a803d0d446c739b041 1480638508
obj /usr/share/man/man3/krb5_h_addr2sockaddr.3 2f053615414fa3818b895e92aa6e946c 1480638508

obj /usr/include/gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h 0d372cba56fe39358de0ef372f5d9ac9 1480638496
obj /usr/include/krb5.h 878de68257806f1459541cca44c9ac84 1480638494
```

The file is there, just not in a subdirectory. Now I'm switching tracks, contemplating if symlinks for compatibility is the more correct answer.

## kerberos Analysis

The first thing I do is look at the providers for `virtual/krb5`:

```

# $Id$

EAPI=5

inherit multilib-build

IUSE=""

RDEPEND="

        >=app-crypt/heimdal-1.5.3-r2[${MULTILIB_USEDEP}]
    )"
```

Now I need to see what files mit-krb5 will install in the krb5 include directory. So I'll uninstall heimdal temporarily and install mit-krb5 instead:

```
# emerge -C heimdal && emerge mit-krb5
```

Now to check includes:

```
# grep "krb5.h" /var/db/pkg/app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.14.2/CONTENTS
obj /usr/include/krb5/hostrealm_plugin.h 48c32ebbaf8959df2572eb05b091a9a0 1480640394
obj /usr/include/krb5/krb5.h 6bbfca10164ccf1c79648c244026e81e 1480640394
obj /usr/include/gssapi/gssapi_krb5.h 1984505c65ed624dd1f230db026e9c91 1480640394
obj /usr/include/krb5.h 0c4035c83c635826e134e10f9947aaba 1480640394
```

So the includes are fairly similar, including the presence of krb5.h without a subdirectory. Still the hashes appear to be different so just to be safe:

```
# cat /usr/include/krb5.h
/* -*- mode: c; c-basic-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil -*- */
/* The MIT Kerberos header file krb5.h used to live here.

   As of the 1.5 release, we're installing multiple Kerberos headers,
   so they're all moving to a krb5/ subdirectory.  This file is
   present just to keep old software still compiling.  Please update
   your code to use the new path for the header.  */
#include <krb5/krb5.h>
```

So it appears this is backwards compatibility, making it difficult to simply assume `<krb5.h>` by itself will be the proper solution. Now I consider creating compatibility with heimdal instead but need to check and see if it's just `krb5.h` or if other files are needed as well. To do this I simply run the heimdal ebuild to the install phase (I also realize I could have done this with mit-krb5 instead of the uninstall/reinstall deal):

```
# ebuild heimdal-1.5.3-r2.ebuild clean install
# /var/tmp/portage/app-crypt/heimdal-1.5.3-r2/image/usr/include
# ls
asn1-common.h  der.h          gssapi      hdb.h         heim-ipc.h         hx509.h         kdc.h         krb5_err.h      kx509_asn1.h   parse_units.h  pkinit_asn1.h   roken.h     x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
asn1_err.h     der-private.h  gssapi.h    hdb-protos.h  heimntlm.h         hx509-protos.h  kdc-protos.h  krb5.h          ntlm_err.h     pkcs10_asn1.h  resolve.h       rtbl.h      xdbm.h
base64.h       der-protos.h   hcrypto     heim_asn1.h   heimntlm-protos.h  k524_err.h      krb5          krb5-private.h  ocsp_asn1.h    pkcs12_asn1.h  rfc2459_asn1.h  sl.h
cms_asn1.h     digest_asn1.h  hdb_asn1.h  heimbase.h    hex.h              kadm5           krb5_asn1.h   krb5-protos.h   parse_bytes.h  pkcs8_asn1.h   roken           wind_err.h
crmf_asn1.h    getarg.h       hdb_err.h   heim_err.h    hx509_err.h        kafs.h          krb5_ccapi.h  krb5-types.h    parse_time.h   pkcs9_asn1.h   roken-common.h  wind.h
include # ls krb5
ccache_plugin.h  locate_plugin.h  send_to_kdc_plugin.h  windc_plugin.h

```

Now to check files in the mit-krb5 includes:

```
include # ls /usr/include/krb5/
ccselect_plugin.h  clpreauth_plugin.h  hostrealm_plugin.h  kadm5_hook_plugin.h  kdcpreauth_plugin.h  krb5.h  localauth_plugin.h  locate_plugin.h  plugin.h  preauth_plugin.h  pwqual_plugin.h
```

It's at this point I realize that even if I create a `<krb5/krb5.h>` symlink with heimdal that someone could still include other files in the `<krb5/>` directory. There's also a slight hunch that data structure differences may foil my attempts as well.

## Roadblock

Based on the fact that 2014-ish was the last heimdal release, and that there are recent mit-krb5 releases that the best effort solution is to have a symlink for `<krb5/krb5.h>` to cover as many of the cases as possible. Time to test out if this is the actual solution needed.

I make a copy of the current heimdal ebuild with a revision bump, then add the necessary symlink for `krb5.h`:

```
$ heimdal-1.5.3-r2.ebuild heimdal-1.5.3-r3.ebuild

# This is a basic attempt to keep compatibility with
# later versions of mit-krb5 which have krb5.h in
# /usr/include/krb5/ instead of just /usr/include
# While mit-krb5 also includes a /usr/include/krb5.h
# for compatibility purposes it is not something that
# should be considered definate for future release.
# Also note that there are also files in <krb5/> which
# are not included in heimdal so this is not a 100%
# solution but should cover most cases.
dosym "../krb5.h" "/usr/include/krb5/krb5.h"
```

Now for verification this all works:

```
# emerge -C mit-krb5 && emerge heimdal && emerge openldap
...

                 from ../../../servers/slapd/slap.h:39,
                 from kinit.c:24:

     (!strcmp(creds.server->data[0].data, "krbtgt")) &&
                          ^

     (!strcmp(creds.server->data[0].data, "krbtgt")) &&
```

## Decision

It's at this point I realize my slight hunch was right. Not only are there differences in include file locations, but also in various structures. With all the research done it's clear that this package cannot depend on the virtual and needs to depend specifically on mit-krb5.
